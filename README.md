Our school expects us to log in every day to check if they've said anything important.

That's harder to remember than you might think, and a bit backwards...

It's like this: "Check with me every day if I have anything important to tell you. Most days I won't, but you have to ask me if I do".
When in real life it works like this: "I have some urgent important information, I better call/text/email them right away".

...So I build this thing that checks for me, and emails me if there's any news.
I get called right away, so to speak.
